Approved,How long does it take for the flu vaccine to be fully ready for deployment into the population ?,"Bacteria can be grown in the laboratory on nutrient culture media, but viruses need living cells in which to replicate.

Millions of eggs are used each year to generate the flu vaccine requirements, a complex <font color=""red"">process that takes about six months</font> after the decision is made as to what strains of virus to include in the new vaccine.

Approved,How long did Pushyamitra Shunga rule?,"The Shunga Empire or Shunga Empire was an ancient Indian dynasty from Magadha that controlled vast areas of the Indian subcontinent from around 187 to 78 BCE.

Art, education, philosophy, and other forms of learning flowered during this period including small terracotta images, larger stone sculptures, and architectural monuments such as the Stupa at Bharhut, and the renowned Great Stupa at Sanchi. The Shunga rulers helped to establish the tradition of royal sponsorship of learning and art. The script used by the empire was a variant of Brahmi and was used to write the Sanskrit language.

Approved,How much did the Governor of Georgia budget per year to provide every child with a CD of classical music?,"During the 1990s, several research papers and popular books wrote on what came to be called the ""Mozart effect"": an observed temporary, small elevation of scores on certain tests as a result of listening to Mozart's works. The approach has been popularized in a book by Don Campbell, and is based on an experiment published in Nature suggesting that listening to Mozart temporarily boosted students' IQ by 8 to 9 points. This popularized version of the theory was expressed succinctly by the New York Times music columnist Alex Ross: ""researchers... have determined that listening to Mozart actually makes you smarter."" Promoters marketed CDs claimed to induce the effect.

Approved,How much did the Swiss economy grow in 2010?,"Switzerland voted against membership in the European Economic Area in a referendum in December 1992 and has since maintained and developed its relationships with the European Union (EU) and European countries through bilateral agreements.

Approved,What century did Aretas III Philhellene reign?,"The Nabatean Kingdom was an Arab state located between the Sinai Peninsula and the Arabian Peninsula.

Approved,What is a common method used during regression testing?,"Regression testing focuses on finding defects after a major code change has occurred . Specifically , it seeks to uncover software regressions , as degraded or lost features , including old bugs that have come back . Such regressions occur whenever software functionality that was previously working correctly , stops working as intended . Typically , regressions occur as an unintended consequence of program changes , when the newly developed part of the software collides with the previously existing code . Common methods of regression testing include <font color=""red"">re - running previous sets of test - cases</font> and checking whether previously fixed faults have re - emerged . The depth of testing depends on the phase in the release process and the risk of the added features . They can either be complete , for changes added late in the release or deemed to be risky , or be very shallow , consisting of positive tests on each feature , if the changes are early in the release or deemed to be of low risk . Regression testing is typically the largest test effort in commercial software development , due to checking numerous details in prior software features , and even new software can be developed while using some old test - cases to test parts of the new design to ensure prior functionality is still supported .",re - running previous sets of test - cases,572940641d046914007791fb,"In the question, X is within 2 words after ""what is"".

Approved,What's the technical term for abnormal cell death?,"Tuberculosis is classified as one of the granulomatous inflammatory diseases . Macrophages , T lymphocytes , B lymphocytes , and fibroblasts aggregate to form granulomas , with lymphocytes surrounding the infected macrophages . When other macrophages attack the infected macrophage , they fuse together to form a giant multinucleated cell in the alveolar lumen . The granuloma may prevent dissemination of the mycobacteria and provide a local environment for interaction of cells of the immune system . However , more recent evidence suggests that the bacteria use the granulomas to avoid destruction by the host 's immune system . Macrophages and dendritic cells in the granulomas are unable to present antigen to lymphocytes ; thus the immune response is suppressed . Bacteria inside the granuloma can become dormant , resulting in latent infection . Another feature of the granulomas is the development of abnormal cell death ( <font color=""red"">necrosis</font> ) in the center of tubercles . To the naked eye , this has the texture of soft , white cheese and is termed caseous necrosis .",necrosis,572773e9f1498d1400e8f885,"The answer is between ""("" and "")"".

Approved,"After discharging and disconnecting a capacitor, what causes it to develop a voltage?","Capacitors made with any type of dielectric material will show some level of "" dielectric absorption "" or "" soakage "" . On discharging a capacitor and disconnecting it , after a short time it may develop a voltage due to <font color=""red"">hysteresis in the dielectric</font> . This effect can be objectionable in applications such as precision sample and hold circuits or timing circuits . The level of absorption depends on many factors , from design considerations to charging time , since the absorption is a time - dependent process . However , the primary factor is the type of dielectric material . Capacitors such as tantalum electrolytic or polysulfone film exhibit very high absorption , while polystyrene or Teflon allow very small levels of absorption . In some capacitors where dangerous voltages and energies exist , such as in flashtubes , television sets , and defibrillators , the dielectric absorption can recharge the capacitor to hazardous voltages after it has been shorted or discharged . Any capacitor containing over 10 joules of energy is generally considered hazardous , while 50 joules or higher is potentially lethal . A capacitor may regain anywhere from 0.01 to 20 % of its original charge over a period of several minutes , allowing a seemingly safe capacitor to become surprisingly dangerous .",hysteresis in the dielectric,57270e2b708984140094d90b,"The answer is within three words after X.

Approved,What is communication viewed as?,"In a slightly more complex form a sender and a receiver are linked reciprocally . This second attitude of communication , referred to as the constitutive model or constructionist view , focuses on how an individual communicates as the determining factor of the way the message will be interpreted . Communication is viewed as <font color=""red"">a conduit</font> ; a passage in which information travels from one individual to another and this information becomes separate from the communication itself . A particular instance of communication is called a speech act . The sender 's personal filters and the receiver 's personal filters may vary depending upon different regional traditions , cultures , or gender ; which may alter the intended meaning of message contents . In the presence of "" communication noise "" on the transmission channel ( air , in this case ) , reception and decoding of content may be faulty , and thus the speech act may not achieve the desired effect . One problem with this encode - transmit - receive - decode model is that the processes of encoding and decoding imply that the sender and receiver each possess something that functions as a codebook , and that these two code books are , at the very least , similar if not identical . Although something like code books is implied by the model , they are nowhere represented in the model , which creates many conceptual difficulties .",a conduit,570979ba200fba1400368045,"In the question Y is directly after X and X is directly after ""what is"".
